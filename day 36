You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int length=prices.length;
        int small=prices[0];
        int profit=0,a,i;
        for(i=0;i<length;i++){
             if(small>prices[i])
             {
                small=prices[i];
             }
             a=prices[i]-small;
             if(profit<=a)
             {
                profit=a;
             }
        }
          return profit;
     }
